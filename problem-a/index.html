    <h1>Remy</h1>
    <img src="img/remy.jpg" alt="remy smiling">
    <p>This is Remy. He is the five-star underground chef in Paris in the movie 
        <cite><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/">Ratatouille</a></cite>.<br> 
        He is a rat that can read, cook, and control a human by his hair, 
        cooking the finest meal that surprises the food critiques of Paris.
        <br><br>
        I admire Remy for the following reasons:<br>
        <ul>
            <li class="important">He experimented cooking with lightnings and chimney smokes.</li>
            <li>He served his colony by detecting rat poisons thanks to supreme smelling abilities.</li>
            <li>He turned a garbage boy into the most famous chef in Paris.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
